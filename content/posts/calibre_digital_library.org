Looking for a software to manage my ebooks. almost everyone recommends to calibre

*** Installing
Binary installation

  sudo -v && wget -nv -O- https://download.calibre-ebook.com/linux-installer.sh | sudo sh /dev/stdin
#+end_src

once installed i am able to open the calibre

*** Library path
you can change the location where the books are stored by clicking the
*Calibre library* in tool bar. The default location will be
#+begin_example
~/Calibre Library
#+end_example

*** Appearance changes
Default appearance of the calibre looks pretty old let's change
it. select preference and click look & feel
- Dark mode
- Set the font to Jet brains Mono nerd font (My preference)
- Change the icon pack to Monstre
  
You can select different layout option using *layout* button in the status bar

*** Adding book
You can start adding books
- By drag and dropping the books
- Add books button
- Using calibredb command


When you are trying to access calibre functions from the terminal
ensure the GUI application is not opened or it will raise some errors

*** Calibredb
One of the coolest way to add books is to use *calibredb* command line tool. Check whether calibredb is accesible from terminal using the following command
#+begin_src shell
  calibredb list
#+end_src
This will list all the books available in calibre. To add new books to the library
#+begin_src shell
  calibredb add [options] file1 file2
#+end_src
you can more operation using calibredb like editing meta data, remove ebook.

*** Calibre web server
- Start the web server using following command
  #+begin_src shell
    calibre-server
  #+end_src
- Web server with custom port
  #+begin_src shell
    calibre-server --port=9876
  #+end_src

*** OPDS
- OPDS is a protocol to access your ebook library in other devices
- URL for your OPDS is *HOSTNAME:PORT/opds* eg: 192.268.1.10:8080/opds
- Software that i use to consume content from OPDS
  - Foliate (linux ebook reader)
    - https://johnfactotum.github.io/foliate/
  - Librera Reader (Android)
    - https://github.com/foobnix/LibreraReader
    - Download the Pro version from github repo.
    - Network tab in the app
    - If network tab is not there then reset(not reinstall) the app
*** Convert ebooks from terminal
- you can convert books from GUI. i prefer terminal tools
  #+begin_src shell
    ebook-convert input_file output_file [options]
  #+end_src

*** Backuping up
To backup the library all we need is to copy the content of *Calibre
Library* like a monthly once or twice. Depends on your needs
